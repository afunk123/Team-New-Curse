# Blight of Blood
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
The theme for the Game Jam was "Reverse" and we exemplified that by turning many stereotypes on their head such as:
- Reverse XP System
- - Players now get weaker and weaker instead of leveling up
- Music 
- - Music will reverse itself if allowed to play long enough

## Impediments
- Our group had a hard time with pushing and pulling things to GitHub.
- Somethimes things would just be lost in translation or accidentatlly be overwritten.
