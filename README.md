# Blight of Blood
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
We implemented a reverse XP system where instead of getting stronger from each fight, you instead lose stats.

## Game Play
Defeat the Vampire Lord who placed this curse upon you while avoiding enemies!

## Impediments
Like everything, lol. 

## Implementation
Features moving enemies, a basic combat system with 3 attack options, and 4 enemies all with different attacks!

## References
The player sprite was made by m-acrophage. (https://m-acrophage.itch.io/side-scrolling-hack-n-slash-character)

## Future Development
